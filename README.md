# Spring Boot Properties Logger

_Properties Logger_ is a module for Spring Boot 3+ apps which early logs properties
detected by Spring Boot and their values resolved by Spring Boot.

## Requirements

The _properties Logger_ module is designed to work with :

- Spring Boot 3.3+ (an so java 17+)
- Servlet web application
- Reactive web application (not tested)
- Batch application application (not tested)
- CommandLineRunner application (not tested)
- Spring boot version < 3.3 (not tested)

## Usage

Usage is simple : just add this dependency inside your pom.xml :

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>fr.insee</groupId>
    <artifactId>boot-properties-logger-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

NB :

1. the lib is not deployed on maven central for the moment so you must install
   it locally before using it :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/FBibonne/Properties-Logger.git --depth=1 --branch=master
$ mvn install -f Properties-Logger/pom.xml
```

Now ou can also download it
from [the github project packages](https://github.com/FBibonne/Properties-Logger/packages/2229078)

2. The module module _Properties Logger_ logs its message with properties and their values
   at the info level : so its **log level must be at least INFO**. DEBUG (or TRACE) give (much) more
   informations.

## Result

You should see this kind of output in your log (in the console by default in a Spring Boot app) :

```text

 :: Spring Boot ::                (v3.3.1)
```

The first part of the log message generated by the module (before the separator `====` )
lists the sources from wich properties keys are collected : only the property sources
which are enumerable and [which are not excluded](#excluded-properties-sources) are listed there

The second part of the log message (after the separator `====` ) lists collected properties
key which starts with [one element of the prefix list](#prefix-list-for-displayed-properties)
and its value resolved by Spring Boot. The displayed value **is not necessarily** the one
which is defined in the property source where Spring Boot encoutered the key, neither one
of the values defined in other displayed property source but the real one that Spring Boot
would provide to your application (for example in a `@Value` annotation) following [its
property resolver algorithm](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html)

For example, given the property key `spring.datasource.username`. If it is defined in the
application.properties file with `user_dev` value :

```properties
spring.datasource.username=user_dev
```

But the environement variable `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` is also defined with the value
`user_prod`.

The _Properties Logger_ module will display the property `spring.datasource.username` (because
by default the keys listed in the application.properties file ar listed) but with the value of
`user_prod` as resolved by Spring Boot due to the environment variable. The environment variable
is not listed because by default the property keys in the system environment property source (`systemEnvironment`)
are not displayed.

Values of [properties with secrets](#properties-with-hidden-values) are hidden when they are printed :
`******` is displayed instead. For example `spring.datasource.password = ******`. To be hidden, the
property key must contain one of the words from the list [properties with secrets](#properties-with-hidden-values).

## Configuration

We describe here configurations which can be applied to the module _Properties Logger_ via
properties prefixed by `properties.logger`. They are three of them:

- [`properties.logger.sources-ignored`](#excluded-properties-sources)
- [`properties.logger.prefix-for-properties`](#prefix-list-for-displayed-properties)
- [`properties.logger.with-hidden-values`](#properties-with-hidden-values)

### Excluded properties sources

| Related Property                    | Default value                       |
|-------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| `properties.logger.sources-ignored` | systemProperties, systemEnvironment |

At starting, Spring Boot can process many property sources and not all of them provide values for
the properties used in your application. Particularly the system properties (java properties which
can be read with `System#getProperty`) and the OS environment variables (can be read with `System#getenv`)
contain many key-value pairs which you do not directly use in your application : displaying
them make the log too much verbose. So you can exclude the properties key exclusively defined by these property
sources listing them in the  `properties.logger.sources-ignored`.

By default the system properties (`systemProperties`) and the environment variables(`systemEnvironment`)
are excluded. You can exclude more properties source by adding their names to the list.

> For example, to not not take into account property keys from :
> 1. the file application.properties
> 2. a file with a relative path ` ../secrets/secret.properties`
> 3. the command line arguments
> 4. the `properties` attribute of `@SpringBootTest` and others @*Test annotations,
     > you should set these values :

```properties
properties.logger.sources-ignored=systemProperties, systemEnvironment,\
[application.properties],\
../secrets/secret.properties,\
commandLineArgs,\
Inlined\ Test\ Properties
```

> At first line, set default exclusions (RECOMMENDED) then add others exclusions :
>
> 2. at second line, for the the application.properties file,
> 3. at third line for ../secrets/secret.properties file
> 4. at fourth line for command line arguments
> 5. at fifth line for then properties attributes for tests

**NB** :

When you exclude a property source, you do not exclude property values of this source
since if the property is present in an other source not excluded and if the value for
this property is resolved to the value of the excluded source, the value of the excluded
source will be displayed in logs. Furthermore, when you exclude a property source you
do not exclude properties which are also listed at least in one another _not excluded_
property source.

### Prefix list for displayed properties

| Related Property                          | Default value                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `properties.logger.prefix-for-properties` | debug, trace, info, logging, spring, server, management, springdoc, properties |

Only the properties whose keys start with one of the prefix listed in `properties.logger.prefix-for-properties` will be
displayed
(if they ar also in a non excluded property source). If you set `properties.logger.prefix-for-properties` to empty, no
property will be displayed. It is recommended to set the value of `properties.logger.prefix-for-properties` to the
default
plus the beginning of your company name to display the properties for your application.

### Properties with hidden values

| Related Property                       | Default value                                |
|----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `properties.logger.with-hidden-values` | password, pwd, token, secret, credential, pw |

When a property is displayed, there is a filter which avoid to leak secrets in logs : all properties whose key contains 
one of the token in `properties.logger.with-hidden-values` will be displayed with the value `******` instead of the actual value.
The default value of `properties.logger.with-hidden-values`  contains the most common tokens for secrets but you should 
add the specific ones you may have in your application.


## Warnings

### Properties from `@DynamicPropertySource` methods will not be displayed

The Properties-Logger library cannot access to the property source of `@DynamicPropertySource` methods because
the properties logger library runs before the `@DynamicPropertySource` methods  are executed. Therefore, **neither the properties
keys exclusively defined in `@DynamicPropertySource` methods, neither the values defined in this methods, whatever the 
property key is, will be displayed** even if  `@DynamicPropertySource` methods property source is not excluded.

`@DynamicPropertySource` methods are a specific mecanism dedicated to test which let you define or overrride properties values 
very late so it is not in the scope of the Properties Logger library which aims to display properties at the earliest time 
in the application lifecycle. It is strongly recommended to not define in other place properties from `@DynamicPropertySource` 
methods. If you have no other choice (make sure you had a complete look to 
[the numerous ways to override properties in Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html) )
that defining `@DynamicPropertySource` methods to override properties in a test and you want to check the value of the 
overrided property, consider logging it yourself or write an assertion in your test
